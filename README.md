## üí° Pro Tips

### Prompt Engineering
- Be specific and descriptive
- Include quality keywords: "masterpiece", "best quality", "highly detailed"
- Mention art styles: "digital painting", "photorealistic", "concept art"
- Add technical terms: "8k uhd", "professional photography", "cinematic lighting"

### Parameter Optimization
- **CFG Scale**: 1-5 (very creative), 7-10 (balanced), 15+ (strict prompt following)
- **Steps**: 20-30 (fast), 30-50 (quality), 50+ (maximum quality)
- **Negative Prompts**: Use to avoid unwanted elements

### Performance Tips
- Start with SD 1.5 models for testing
- Use lower steps for experimentation
- Switch to SDXL for final high-quality results
- Enable memory optimizations for large images
- Use batch generation for variations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Out of Memory Errors**
- Reduce image size
- Use SD 1.5 instead of SDXL
- Enable CPU offload
- Restart the application

**Slow Generation**
- Lower the number of steps
